# Electron Loading Demo
This repo is a simple example of implementing events to trigger a loading 
window while an Electron app is downloading remote content.

I'm using [Throttle](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-throttle#readme) to 
slow downloads for demonstration purposes. You do not want to include this code 
in any production builds.
